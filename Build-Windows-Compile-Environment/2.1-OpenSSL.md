a) From a MinGw shell (that window we opened), unpack the source archive with tar (this will avoid symlink issues) then configure and make (one command per line):
			cd /c/deps/

			tar xvfz openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz

			cd openssl-1.0.1e

			Configure mingw

			make

Ta da!  You just compiled OpenSSL!

IF THIS FAILS... IF YOU SEE THE WORD "ERROR" OR "WHATEVER OF THE SORT... GO BACK TO STEP 1.5 AND TRY AGAIN.

If it works it doesn't pat you on the back.  It just stops without saying "ERROR".  Welcome to software development.
