3.0 Download the Spacecash source code
--------------
a) From a MSYS type:

Now... for the graphical wallet... and we're going to go really fast because you're a f'in pro now.

4. Compiling Qt 5.2.0 libraries and Spacecash-Qt 
--------------
4.1 Download and unpack Qt base and tools sources:

a) http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.2/5.2.0/submodules/qtbase-opensource-src-5.2.0.7z
* Make a directory called C:\Qt
* Unpack the contents of the file into C:\Qt
* Rename the directory from qtbase-opensource-src-5.2.0 to 5.2.0

b) http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.2/5.2.0/submodules/qttools-opensource-src-5.2.0.7z
* Unpack the contents of the file into C:\Qt

c) Open a command prompt and type:

	cd\Qt\5.2.0

	configure.bat -release -opensource -confirm-license -static -make libs -no-sql-sqlite -no-opengl -qt-zlib -qt-pcre -no-icu -no-gif -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -no-angle -no-vcproj -no-openssl -no-dbus -no-audio-backend -no-wmf-backend -no-qml-debug

	mingw32-make

e) Remember when we had to check the Path variable before?  We need to do that again.  Reference the instructions above on how to access it.  Add the following path to the beginning:

	C:\Qt\5.2.0\bin;

f) close and reopen the command prompt window so the new path will take effect.

g) Type:

	cd C:\Qt\qttools-opensource-src-5.2.0

	qmake qttools.pro

	mingw32-make

5. Compiling the Spacecash-Qt client
--------------


5.1 In the command prompt type:

	cd\Spacecash

	qmake Spacecash-qt.pro

	mingw32-make -f Makefile.Release

YOU DID IT!

Don't forget to create your .conf files!
